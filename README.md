# Sign Language Recognition System (SLRS)

## Goal

Implement a Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow to recognize sign language gestures.

## Incremental Development

Develop the model incrementally, starting with a few gestures and building upwards.

## Results

Final model trained to classify 6 gestures with 92.47% accuracy.

## Dataset

Used the "HaGRID - HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset" dataset from hagrid.
